# ACS 2022 Ratio Estimator Analysis

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to estimate the total number of respondents in each U.S. state using data from the 2022 ACS and the ratio estimator approach. The analysis compares these estimates to the actual respondent counts and explores potential reasons for discrepancies.

## Description
This project leverages the 2022 ACS dataset obtained from IPUMS USA. It specifically focuses on respondents with doctoral degrees as their highest educational attainment to calculate state-level ratios. These ratios are used to estimate total respondents per state based on the known total respondent count in California. Results include a comparison between estimated and actual counts, along with visualizations and insights into the differences.
